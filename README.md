#Poker Hand Sorting Algorithm

This is the code that I developed in response to the CodeWars challenge Sortable Poker Hands which 
can be viewed here: https://www.codewars.com/kata/sortable-poker-hands

This then provided the inspiration for my Best Poker Hand app which I am currently working on 
to assist new players in increasing the speed with which they can recognise and understand
the basic mechanics of a game of Texas Hold'em Poker.
